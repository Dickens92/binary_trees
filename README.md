0x1D. C -BIRNARY TREES

*LEARNING OBJECTIVES*

$ What is a binary tree
$ What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
$ What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
$ What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
$ What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
$ What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
